# ExpressMD.scss
A .scss template modeled around the color pallete specified by Google's Material Design .

## How to use
ExpressMD is simply a SCSS file I have always used to start out my web projects; It assigns and semantically names every single color specified in Google's [Material Design Documentation](https://material.google.com/) to an SCSS variable for easy accesibility of the pallette. Its various comments indicate where certain colors are in the list(the variable names indicate this as well). If needed, the scss variables that are not used can be removed. Although the unnecesary space of the variables may increase the amount of space taken on your host, SCSS is compiled into a CSS file, so the variables will NOT be loaded every time your page is accessed.
